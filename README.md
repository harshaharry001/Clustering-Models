# Clustering-Models

#### In this repository we are going to see 5 different types of clustering models. I tried for implementing 8 different models but only implemented 5 clustering models. The dataset for this is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The following are the list of clustering models that I implemented:

#### *K-Means Clustering*
#### *DBSCAN Clustering*
#### *Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering*
#### *Spectral Clustering*
#### *BIRCH Clustering*

#### Here I made the clustering on same dataset but in three different kinds. First we have taken the dataset as it is by just standardizing the data. Second we have performed PCA on the standardized dataset with a maximum of 12 PCA components. Third we have performed PCA on the same standardized dataset with only 2 PCA components.

#### For these three datasets I have performed all the above 5 mentioned clustering methods and even plotted the clusters using the scatter plot.
